- Each filename for test class must have a suffix on `*Test.php`.
- Each test class must extend a `WeatherWidgetTests\TestCase` class.
- You can also add some code to `WeatherWidgetTests\TestCase.php`
- Each test method must have prefix `test_`
- Additional files for autoloading in tests running you can add to `.codeception/_support/*` folder.

## Brief 

The key technical solutions are working with API from api.openweathermap.org and using a transient cache.

Also when running the plugin class

```
( new Plugin( new Api() ) )->init();
```

I am passing the API class as a parameter, so in the future, it will be possible to change the source of obtaining data to a class for obtaining data from a file, from a database, etc.

## Testing

Check situations

1. empty settings /wp-admin/options-general.php

2. wrong API key

3. wrong city name

4. check cache

5. validation of unit tests

```
composer unit
```

## How long the test took to complete

In total, it took me about 10 hours. This time includes preparing the project for deployment, writing unit tests
